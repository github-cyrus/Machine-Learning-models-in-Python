Implemented Algorithms
1️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A simple, instance-based learning algorithm for classification and regression.

Uses distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.) to classify new data points.

2️⃣ Linear Regression

A supervised learning algorithm for predicting continuous values.

Finds the best-fit line using the least squares method.

3️⃣ Logistic Regression

A classification algorithm that predicts categorical outcomes.

Uses the sigmoid function to estimate probabilities.

4️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A powerful supervised learning model for classification and regression.

Uses hyperplanes to separate data into different classes.
